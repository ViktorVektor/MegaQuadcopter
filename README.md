A custom quadcopter I started back in highschool and only got around the finishing durng the pandemic. It boasts a 5" frame with 2204 motors, can take 3S or 4S and has FPV capabilities. It weighs in at about 500g.

### Purpose

I was inspired by videos online of people flying around their drones with a First Person View, where an onboard camera would transmit a live video feed to the user's headset display. Looking into prebuilt systems, I found that most were out of my pricerange as a teenager with a part time job, so I opted to build one out of various parts I found online.

### October 2017: Specification research

Though the initial interest came to me much earlier, I decided to start it a few months later into the year

I started out by finding the cheapest parts I could find on a popular hobbyist website and configured by drone from there. I knew I wanted a somewhat stable experience, so a bigger drone was desireable. Smaller drones were typically harder to work with and often more expensive at the time. I also did not have other equipment like a transmitter and a display which added to the cost of the project.

### February 2018: Construction

This is a photo of the Power Distribution Board (PDB) being soldered. Up to this point, I had limited experience in soldering so this project was a good way for my to build up my skills. In the photo, a perforated board can be seen underneath the PDB. This was due to the carbon fiber frame having a different mounting profile as the PDB and Flight Controller I would be using, an oversight on my part. A solution (although one I thought would be temporary at the time) I found was to have an adapter plate between the two components.
